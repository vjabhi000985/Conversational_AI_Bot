# AI Powered Data Science Tutor with Gemini Pro
## Description:
This project creates a user-friendly Streamlit application called "AI Powered Data Science Tutor." It leverages the capabilities of Google's Generative AI platform, specifically the powerful Gemini-1.5-pro-latest model, to provide an interactive learning experience for aspiring data scientists.

### Features:
- `Conversational Tutoring`: Users can interact with the AI tutor by entering questions or topics related to data science through a chat-like interface.
- `Gemini Pro Integration`: The app utilizes the advanced capabilities of Gemini Pro to analyze user input and generate informative and comprehensive responses.
- `Streamlit Integration`: Streamlit provides a user-friendly and interactive framework for the chat interface and displaying responses.

## Getting Started:
### 1. Prerequisites:
- Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
- Install the required libraries: pip install streamlit streamlit-option-menu google-generativeai
- Obtain a Google Generative AI API key and store it securely in a file named .gemini_api_key.txt within a keys folder in your project directory. (Refer to Google's Generative AI documentation for API key creation)

### 2. Run the App:
- Navigate to your project directory in the terminal.
- Run the command `streamlit run main.py` (replace `main.py` with your actual script name) to launch the app in your web browser.

## Usages:
- Interact with the AI tutor by entering your questions or data science topics in the chat interface.
- The AI tutor will analyze your input and provide informative responses using the Gemini Pro model.

## Further Development:
- Enhance the chat interface with features like history and user profile management.
- Integrate the ability for users to provide feedback on AI responses for continuous learning.
- Expand the scope of topics covered by the AI tutor by developing a more comprehensive model and integrating it with Gemini pro to generate better and more accurate results.
